                Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us. The Company recognizes that parents, 
guardians, or other adults often purchase our products for family use, including use by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the purchaser of the product and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under 13 submits personal information to the Company and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. It is our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws. Therefore, we restrict our web sites to people 18 years or older.

This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base.

                In some of our email messages we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on our web sites. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.               </p>

                In addition, we use pixel tags—tiny graphic images—to tell us what parts of our web sites customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we're sending only messages that are of interest to our customers. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a customer. We store   this information in a secure database located in Florida in the United States.
